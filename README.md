# Bash - 

## Dependencies

* **'image_downloader.sh'** : Requires Wget. Wget is an non-interactive down-loader which downloads files from the web. HTTP and FTP protocols being used for downloading the files over internet. However if you don’t have installed wget utility on your system then you'll get a “bash: wget: command not found” error while executing the script. Download from https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/. Once downloaded, unzip and configure environment PATH variable to point to inside the unzipped folder so that your terminal has access to the wget.exe file. Done :)


More scripts coming...
